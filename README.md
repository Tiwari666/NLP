Objective: To read the tsb (Tab-Separated Values) make them usable for further analysis.

If  a dataset is in a TSV (Tab-Separated Values) file  format instead of a CSV file format, one can use the same pd.read_csv() function to read it into a pandas DataFrame. One just need to specify the sep parameter as '\t' to indicate that the values are separated by tabs.
