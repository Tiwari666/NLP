#Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the interaction between computers and human languages. The goal of NLP is to enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a way that is both meaningful and contextually relevant.

# Application of NLP:
1) *Text Classification:** NLP algorithms are employed for text classification tasks, such as email filtration :spam detection, fishing attempts, sentiment analysis, and topic categorization.

2) *Sentiment Analysis**
Sentiment analysis is the process of analyzing emotions within a text and classifying them as positive, negative, or neutral. By running sentiment analysis on social media posts, product reviews, NPS surveys, and customer feedback, businesses can gain valuable insights about how customers perceive their brand.

3) *Machine Translation**:The automatic translation of text from one language to another is a classic NLP problem. Google Translate is a common example of a machine translation system.

4). **Chatbots:** Businesses use NLP-powered chatbots to provide automated customer support.

5) *SPEECH RECOGNITION**: aLEXA, SIRI,CORTANA, GOOGLE ASSISTANT.

6) **Financial Analysis:** NLP helps analyze financial news, reports, and social media to gain insights into market trends, sentiments, and investment opportunities.
